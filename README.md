# Retail Sales Analysis and Forecasting: Interactive Power BI Dashboard

Power BI dashboard to analyze and forecast Retail Sales data through a systematic approach encompassing data cleaning, data processing, data analysis, data visualization and forecasting techniques. Incorporating an array of visuals such as area charts, donut charts, shape maps, clustered bar charts, stacked bar charts, line charts, tables, cards, and slicers, trends and patterns within the dataset were effectively uncovered. Furthermore the advanced AI-powered visuals like smart narratives were used to seamlessly generate a comprehensive report summary. Additionally, a record of the 14-day sales forecast was recorded in an excel sheet. 

# Project Objective:
The director of a global superstore is facing significant challenges as the sales of retail goods are decreasing rapidly. One of the main issues is the lack of real-time insights into the company's performance, profit margins, sales trends, and future forecasts. To address these challenges, a Power BI Dashboard is developed to present an interactive visual story. By combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predicted sales for the next 14 days using a 4-year retail dataset from a global superstore, this project aims to deliver a comprehensive visual story through the Power BI Dashboard. This dashboard aims to offer real-time progress and sales insights, helping the director make informed strategic decisions, enhance business success, and drive sustained growth. The dashboard will not only display current sales data but also provide accurate forecasts for the next 14 days, enabling the director to respond proactively to market trends and improve the company's performance.
